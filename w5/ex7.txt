1.
systemd has an id of 1

2.
There PID are increasing, using the notation B(1) = PID of the first bash
B(1) < B(2) < B(3) ...

The PID of a process is generated sequentially, incrementaly.
But it is not mendatory that the PID directly follow (B(1) + 1 != B(2)) because the system might have forked thus taking that id

3.
Because there is one instance of systemd runing by user currently logged.
